- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are related with programming or software engineering
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pursuing higher knowledge with programming 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that has to do with science and I'll most likely give you an answer 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my phone number - 786.740.1676 - 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Back in freshman year highschool, I was so intune with engineering that my professor at the time, regraded me and my other freinds to make a special engineering team. Which would have the three of us create specific projects for the subject he taught the same day.
